## 📦 Repository Structure

Main Git repository:  
🔗 [`docker-compose`](https://mygit.th-deg.de/schober-teaching/student-projects/ain-23-software-engineering/ss-25/Sosyo/docker-compose.git)

Includes the following **submodules**:
- [`web-frontend`](https://mygit.th-deg.de/schober-teaching/student-projects/ain-23-software-engineering/ss-25/Sosyo/web-frontend.git)
- [`web-backend`](https://mygit.th-deg.de/schober-teaching/student-projects/ain-23-software-engineering/ss-25/Sosyo/web-backend.git)
- [`model-backend`](https://mygit.th-deg.de/schober-teaching/student-projects/ain-23-software-engineering/ss-25/Sosyo/model-backend.git)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repositories

Clone the main repo along with all submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://mygit.th-deg.de/schober-teaching/student-projects/ain-23-software-engineering/ss-25/Sosyo/docker-compose.git
cd docker-compose
```

> If you forgot to use `--recurse-submodules`, you can initialize them later:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

### 2. Start the Application

Build and run the app using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Once started, visit the app at:  
📍 **http://localhost:8080**

## 🧪 Testing

### ✅ Web Frontend – Cypress E2E Tests

E2E Tests will automatically runs with Docker command, but if you want to run it separately then,

```bash
docker-compose run --rm cypress
```

---

### ✅ Web Backend – Pytest

```bash
docker-compose run --rm backend pytest
```

---

### ✅ Model Backend – Pytest

```bash
docker-compose run --rm model-trainer pytest
```
